Production Line Simulation with PLC & Factory I/O

This project demonstrates a production line automation system where products are automatically sorted by size and then stored in a warehouse. The system is fully simulated using Factory I/O and controlled via PLC programming.

Key Features

Automatic detection and sorting of products by size.
Integration of PLC logic to manage conveyor belts and actuators.
Warehouse storage management after sorting.
Realistic industrial environment modeled in Factory I/O.

Technologies Used

PLC Programming (Siemens / Allen-Bradley or compatible)
Factory I/O for 3D industrial simulation
Automation & Control Engineering concepts
